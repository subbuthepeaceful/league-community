<p>Dear <%= @participant.primary_contact.name %>,</p>

<p><b>We apologize for a slight glitch where our first run of reminder emails sometimes mixed up snack duty assignments across teams.

We hope to have corrected this - once again, thank you for your participation, and our sincere apologies in this regard.</b></p>
